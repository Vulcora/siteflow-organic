No. Our customers often reduce their operating costs by 50-80% because our systems require significantly less server power and less manual maintenance. It's cheaper to build it right once than to fix it every month."

        "question": "What technology do you build with?",
        "answer": "We are technology agnostic but prefer BEAM (Erlang/Elixir) for systems that require extreme reliability and scalability. It's the same technology that powers WhatsApp and parts of 5G networks. For frontend, we use modern frameworks like React or Phoenix LiveView depending on needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do we have to replace everything we have?",

      {
        "question": "How long does a project take?",
